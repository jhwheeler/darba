        <p>Through exploration of one's body, mind, and soul, we dive deep into ourselves, closer and  closer to experiences of the Ultimate. In our workshops, we teach you powerful tools to explore and enhance your conscious-awareness. From the Enneagram to Flow Arts, these ancient systems revitalized with fresh life are all infused with a taste of the Infinite.</p>

          <h2>ENNEAGRAM</h2>
          <p>Through the ancient Sufi knowledge of the Enneagram, the Sacred Map of the Soul, we can come to know ourselves and others. The sacred geometry of this symbol allows us to decipher the threads that connect the microcosm of personality with the macrocosm of the Universal Soul.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>In the beginning of the 20th century, George Gurdjieff brought this ancient knowledge to the West. Many psychologists, such as Oscar Ichazo, Claudio Naranjo, and Katherine Chernick, have since developed the Enneagram into a precise system of self-knowledge and exploration.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>In this one-hour workshop, you will learn to recognize the fundamental characteristics of each archetype, exploring the challenges of your shadow and discovering your true power.</p>
